## Steps into setting up a simple django app

##### Make website folder (which is contextually root folder) using `django-admin start projectname`
- __init__.py is to treat this directory as a Python package( an entity that can be imported with dotted names.)
- wsgi.py is to help communicate with the web server.

##### `python manage.py startapp catalog` to create a new app.


##### Add app in `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.
- SECRET_KEY: This is a secret key that is used as part of Django's website security strategy. If you're not protecting this code in development, you'll need to use a different code (perhaps read from an environment variable or file) when putting it into production.
- DEBUG: This enables debugging logs to be displayed on error, rather than HTTP status code responses. This should be set to False on production as debug information is useful for attackers, but for now we can keep it set to True.

##### Populate urls.py of project_folder
- If linked it with urls.py of an app, populate app's urls too.
- Attaching a general template
        `
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
        path('', RedirectView.as_view(url='/catalog/', permanent=True)),
    ] + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
    `
for an app name catalog.

##### Test if all works minimally
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Open `127.0.0.1:8000` to see the familiar django page. 

##### Create Models

- Decide a model structure. Might have to use uml diagrams.
- App's model.py needs editing. Add this
```python
from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse

# Used to generateURLs by reversingtheURLpatterns
import uuid

# Required for unique book instances


class Genre(models.Model):
    """Model representing a book genre."""

    name = models.CharField(
        max_length=200, help_text="Enter a book genre (e.g. Science Fiction)"
    )

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return self.name


class Book(models.Model):
    """Model representing a book (but not a specific copy of a book)."""

    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    # Foreign Key used because book can only have one author, but authors can
    # have multiple books
    # Author as a string rather than object because it hasn't been declared yet
    # in the file
    author = models.ForeignKey("Author", on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

    summary = models.TextField(
        max_length=1000, help_text="Enter a brief description of the book"
    )
    isbn = models.CharField(
        "ISBN",
        max_length=13,
        help_text="""
        13 Character
        <a href="https://www.isbn-international.org/content/what-isbn">
        ISBN number</a>""",
    )

    # ManyToManyField used because genre can contain many books.
    # Books can cover many genres.
    # Genre class has already been defined so we can specify the object above.
    genre = models.ManyToManyField(Genre, help_text="Select a genre for this book")
    language = models.ForeignKey("Language", on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return self.title

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a detail record for this book."""
        return reverse("book-detail", args=[str(self.id)])


class BookInstance(models.Model):
    """
    Model representing a specific copy of a book
    (i.e. that can be borrowed from the library)."""

    id = models.UUIDField(
        primary_key=True,
        default=uuid.uuid4,
        help_text="Unique ID for this particular book across whole library",
    )
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    imprint = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    due_back = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)

    LOAN_STATUS = (
        ("m", "Maintenance"),
        ("o", "On loan"),
        ("a", "Available"),
        ("r", "Reserved"),
    )

    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        choices=LOAN_STATUS,
        blank=True,
        default="m",
        help_text="Book availability",
    )

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["due_back"]

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the Model object."""
        return f"{self.id} ({self.book.title})"

```

This model.py is incomplete as it has not yet added Author and Language.
Since Author is not yet defined therefore we can not use Author object and use
string "Author" instead unlike for book in BookInstance.

##### Register Model with Admin

- Open catalog's admin.py and paste
```python
from catalog.models import Author, Genre, Book, BookInstance

admin.site.register(Book)
```
- One can customise Admin site to advanced. Follow [this.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Admin_site)

##### So much but no page displayed yet..
- So far catalog's urls is empty. Although we have called this from project's urls so add to catalog/urls.py
```python
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

- In views.py, add index function that above url mapped to
```python
from catalog.models import Book, Author, BookInstance, Genre

def index(request):
    """View function for home page of site."""

    # Generate counts of some of the main objects
    num_books = Book.objects.all().count()
    num_instances = BookInstance.objects.all().count()
    
    # Available books (status = 'a')
    num_instances_available = BookInstance.objects.filter(status__exact='a').count()
    
    # The 'all()' is implied by default.    
    num_authors = Author.objects.count()
    
    context = {
        'num_books': num_books,
        'num_instances': num_instances,
        'num_instances_available': num_instances_available,
        'num_authors': num_authors,
    }

    # Render the HTML template index.html with the data in the context variable
    return render(request, 'index.html', context=context)
```
- render() takes template as index.html and insert context into it to return an HTML response.

#### Create a template
    
Create template/ inside catalog(our app) and inside it create base_generic.html with following code
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  {% block title %}<title>Local Library</title>{% endblock %}
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <!-- Add additional CSS in static file -->
  {% load static %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-2">
      {% block sidebar %}
        <ul class="sidebar-nav">
          <li><a href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="">All books</a></li>
          <li><a href="">All authors</a></li>
        </ul>
     {% endblock %}
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-10 ">{% block content %}{% endblock %}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
This will be extended for every page hence the name.

- See `load static` block this loads style.css and expect it inside css/ and this path is relative to
STATIC_URL defined in settings.py ( pointed out by `static` block inside latter)

- See `block` and `endblock` block which creates holes for data to be inserted

- See `url` block
    The tag here accepts the name of a path() function called in your urls.py 
and the values for any arguments that the associated view will receive from that
function, and returns a URL that you can use to link to the resource.

#### Books and Authors page

- Using generic class-based list views. 
    - Add following to url_patterns in catalog/urls.py
        ```
        path('books/', views.BookListView.as_view(), name='books'),
        ``` 
    - Add following lines in catalog.views.py
```python
from django.views import generic

class BookListView(generic.ListView):
    model = Book
```
That's it! The generic view will query the database to get all records for the specified model (Book) then render a template located at /locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/book_list.html (which we will create below). Within the template you can access the list of books with the template variable named object_list OR book_list (i.e. generically "the_model_name_list").


This awkward path for the template location isn't a misprint â€” the generic views look for templates in /application_name/the_model_name_list.html (catalog/book_list.html in this case) inside the application's /application_name/templates/ directory (/catalog/templates/).

However this awkwardness can be customised to your comfort. e.g. an alternate way is given below
```python
class BookListView(generic.ListView):
    model = Book
    context_object_name = 'my_book_list'   # your own name for the list as a template variable
    queryset = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains='war')[:5] # Get 5 books containing the title war
    template_name = 'books/my_arbitrary_template_name_list.html'  # Specify your own template name/location
```

This is still incomplete until you describe a detail page(as we are using book.get_absolute_url in above template). so let's do that first.

#### Book detail page

- Add in catalog.urls 
```
re_path(r'^book/(?P<pk>\d+)$', views.BookDetailView.as_view(), name='book-detail'),
```

- Add in views
```
class BookDetailView(generic.DetailView):
    model = Book
```

Also, so if there is no record for the given pk then http404 response is sent by django just alright. 
- Create a file book_detail.html inside templates/catalog/ 
```html
{% extends "base_generic.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Title: {{ book.title }}</h1>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="">{{ book.author }}</a></p> <!-- author detail link not yet defined -->
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> {{ book.summary }}</p>
  <p><strong>ISBN:</strong> {{ book.isbn }}</p> 
  <p><strong>Language:</strong> {{ book.language }}</p>  
  <p><strong>Genre:</strong> {{ book.genre.all|join:", " }}</p>  

  <div style="margin-left:20px;margin-top:20px">
    <h4>Copies</h4>

    {% for copy in book.bookinstance_set.all %}
      <hr>
      <p class="{% if copy.status == 'a' %}text-success{% elif copy.status == 'm' %}text-danger{% else %}text-warning{% endif %}">{{ copy.get_status_display }}</p>
      {% if copy.status != 'a' %}
        <p><strong>Due to be returned:</strong> {{copy.due_back}}</p>
      {% endif %}
      <p><strong>Imprint:</strong> {{copy.imprint}}</p>
      <p class="text-muted"><strong>Id:</strong> {{copy.id}}</p>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endblock %}

```
The view will pass it the database information for the specific Book record extracted by the URL mapper. Within the template you can access the list of books with the template variable named object OR book (i.e. generically "the_model_name"). as pointed before, you can always customise.

The one interesting thing we haven't seen before is the function book.bookinstance_set.all(). This method is "automagically" constructed by Django in order to return the set of BookInstance records associated with a particular Book.
And although there is an all(), there is no filter() LOL.

#### Include Pagination

- Add `paginate_by = 10` as an attribute to listview class in views. but this only 
paginates the data. in the sense The different pages are accessed using GET parameters â€” to access page 2 you would use the URL: /catalog/books/?page=2.

- To include this in html,
add following in base_generic.html

```html
{% block content %}{% endblock %}
  
  {% block pagination %}
    {% if is_paginated %}
        <div class="pagination">
            <span class="page-links">
                {% if page_obj.has_previous %}
                    <a href="{{ request.path }}?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}">previous</a>
                {% endif %}
                <span class="page-current">
                    Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }}.
                </span>
                {% if page_obj.has_next %}
                    <a href="{{ request.path }}?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}">next</a>
                {% endif %}
            </span>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
  {% endblock %}
```

#### Sessions Framework

- All communication between web browsers and servers is via the HTTP protocol, which is stateless. 
- Django uses a cookie containing a special session id to identify each browser and its associated session with the site. The actual session data is stored in the site database by default (this is more secure than storing the data in a cookie, where they are more vulnerable to malicious users)
- You can access the session attribute in the view from the request parameter (an HttpRequest passed in as the first argument to the view).The session attribute is a dictionary-like object that you can read and write as many times as you like in your view, modifying it as wished.
- If a session, as a dict, changes then django saves the session itself. However instead
if the data inside the session changed, for example one shown below for wheels, tell
django to modify and save django session manually
- The Session was enabled from start. The configuration is set up in the INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE sections of the project file (locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py)
```python
# This is detected as an update to the session, so session data is saved.
request.session['my_car'] = 'mini'

# Session object not directly modified, only data within the session. Session changes not saved!
request.session['my_car']['wheels'] = 'alloy'

# Set session as modified to force data updates/cookie to be saved.
request.session.modified = True

```

#### Auth

- Django provides an authentication and authorization ("permission") system, built on top of the session framework
- The Auth was enabled from start. The configuration is set up in the INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE sections of the project file (locallibrary/locallibrary/settings.py)

##### Create users and groups
- Our superuser is already authenticated and has all permissions, so we'll need to create a test user to represent a normal site user.
- Create a Group first, use django admin site
- Create a user. One can also use django shell. it is just that easy.
##### Setting up auth views
- We will attach url to main project instead of an app like catalog here
because we want all apps to use same auth model
- Add url
```python
#Add Django site authentication urls (for login, logout, password management)
urlpatterns += [
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]
```
- Create a new folder templates in project. The URLs (and implicitly views) that we just added expect to find their associated templates in a directory /registration/ somewhere in the templates search path.
but since this is a service for the project we will need to create a new folder 'templates' as a sibling to 
catalog (instead of using catalog's template) and in it create registration/.

- Create a login.html inside registration and paste following
```html
{% extends "base_generic.html" %}

{% block content %}

{% if form.errors %}
  <p>Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if next %}
  {% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Your account doesn't have access to this page. To proceed,
    please login with an account that has access.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>Please login to see this page.</p>
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}

<form method="post" action="{% url 'login' %}">
{% csrf_token %}
<table>

<tr>
  <td>{{ form.username.label_tag }}</td>
  <td>{{ form.username }}</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>{{ form.password.label_tag }}</td>
  <td>{{ form.password }}</td>
</tr>
</table>

<input type="submit" value="login" />
<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}" />
</form>

{# Assumes you setup the password_reset view in your URLconf #}
<p><a href="{% url 'password_reset' %}">Lost password?</a></p>

{% endblock %}
```

- After login, default redirect url is 'profile' to change it to index for our case
add following to settings.py
```python
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
```

- for accounts/logout/, django opens admin logout page therefore overwrite this by 
creating a 'logged_out.html'

- did you notice? how template inside templates/registration/ can access base_generic.html
defined inside catalog/templates. This is because we added Templates
configuration in settings.py


##### Password Reset

- just like above point, one has to overwrite for password_reset_form, password_reset_done etc.
- One must also create password_reset_mail template that will be
sent in the email for password reset
- create password_confirm template

##### Use Auth
There are two ways this can be done

- ###### Using in Templates
    - Note also how we have appended ?next={{request.path}} to the end of the URLs. What this does is add a URL parameter next containing the address (URL) of the current page, to the end of the linked URL. After the user has successfully logged in/out, the views will use this "next" value to redirect the user back to the page where they first clicked the login/logout link.
Paste the following in 
    ```html
     {% if user.is_authenticated %}
         <li>User: {{ user.get_username }}</li>
         <li><a href="{% url 'logout'%}?next={{request.path}}">Logout</a></li>   
       {% else %}
         <li><a href="{% url 'login'%}?next={{request.path}}">Login</a></li>   
       {% endif %}
          
    ```

- ###### Using in views

    - in function-based view
    
        - use login_required decorator. pretty clean huh?
        ```python
        from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
        
        @login_required
        def my_view(request):
        .
        .
        .
        
        ```

        - Use is_authenticated attribute
        ```python
        from django.shortcuts import render

        def my_view(request):
            if not request.user.is_authenticated:
                return render(request, 'myapp/login_error.html')
            # ...
        ```
        
    - in class-based view
        
        ```python
        from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
        class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
            login_url = '/login/'
            redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'

        ```
#### Permissions

Permissions are associated with models and define the operations that can be performed on a model instance by a user who has the permission. By default, Django automatically gives add, change, and delete permissions to all models, which allow users with the permissions to perform the associated actions via the admin site. You can define your own permissions to models and grant them to specific users. You can also change the permissions associated with different instances of the same model.

- Add permissions in a model's meta as shown below
    ```python
      class BookInstance(models.Model):
        ...
        class Meta:
            ...
            permissions = (("can_mark_returned", "Set book as returned"),)  
    ```
  needless to say -> makemigrate and migreate
 
- Use in template 
    use {{perm}} variable as shown below
    ```html
      {% if perms.catalog.can_mark_returned %}
            <!-- We can mark a BookInstance as returned. -->
            <!-- Perhaps add code to link to a "book return" view here. -->
      {% endif %}
    ``` 
- Use in view
    - function-based 
        -  permission_required decorator
        ```python
            from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

            @permission_required('catalog.can_mark_returned')
            @permission_required('catalog.can_edit')
            def my_view(request):
               ...

        ```
    - class-based
        ```python
           from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin

           class MyView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
                permission_required = 'catalog.can_mark_returned'
                # Or multiple permissions
                permission_required = ('catalog.can_mark_returned', 'catalog.can_edit')
                # Note that 'catalog.can_edit' is just an example
                # the catalog application doesn't have such permission!
        ```
        
#### Django Forms
Django Forms does most things for you.
The declaration syntax for a Form is very similar to that for declaring a Model, and shares the same field types (and some similar parameters).
- Create and open the file locallibrary/catalog/forms.py and populate with following
    ```python
    import datetime
    from django import forms
    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    
    class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
        renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
    
        def clean_renewal_date(self):
            data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']
            
            # Check if a date is not in the past. 
            if data < datetime.date.today():
                raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))
    
            # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
            if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
                raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))
    
            # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
            return data
    ``` 
- Extend View
    ```python
    import datetime
    
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
    from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.urls import reverse
    
    from catalog.forms import RenewBookForm
    
    @permission_required('catalog.can_mark_returned')
    def renew_book_librarian(request, pk):
        book_instance = get_object_or_404(BookInstance, pk=pk)
    
        # If this is a POST request then process the Form data
        if request.method == 'POST':
    
            # Create a form instance and populate it with data from the request (binding):
            form = RenewBookForm(request.POST)
    
            # Check if the form is valid:
            if form.is_valid():
                # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required (here we just write it to the model due_back field)
                book_instance.due_back = form.cleaned_data['renewal_date']
                book_instance.save()
    
                # redirect to a new URL:
                return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('all-borrowed') )
    
        # If this is a GET (or any other method) create the default form.
        else:
            proposed_renewal_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=3)
            form = RenewBookForm(initial={'renewal_date': proposed_renewal_date})
    
        context = {
            'form': form,
            'book_instance': book_instance,
        }
    
        return render(request, 'catalog/book_renew_librarian.html', context)
  
    ```
    - The if-else block is a very common pattern used to handle post request method,
    - get_object_or_404(): Returns a specified object from a model based on its primary key value, and raises an Http404 exception (not found) if the record does not exist. 
    - HttpResponseRedirect: This creates a redirect to a specified URL (HTTP status code 302).
    - reverse(): This generates a URL from a URL configuration name and a set of arguments. It is the Python equivalent of the url tag that we've been using in our templates.
    - After creating the form, we call render() to create the HTML page, specifying the template and a context that contains our form. In this case, the context also contains our BookInstance, which we'll use in the template to provide information about the book we're renewing.
    - However, if this is a POST request, then we create our form object and populate it with data from the request. This process is called "binding" and allows us to validate the form.
    - If the form is not valid we call render() again, but this time the form value passed in the context will include error messages.
    - While you can also access the form data directly through the request (for example, request.POST['renewal_date'] or request.GET['renewal_date'] if using a GET request), this is NOT recommended. The cleaned data is sanitized, validated, and converted into Python-friendly types.
- Extend Template
    - Create the template referenced in the view (/catalog/templates/catalog/book_renew_librarian.html) and copy the code below into it:
        ```html
        {% extends "base_generic.html" %}

        {% block content %}
          <h1>Renew: {{ book_instance.book.title }}</h1>
          <p>Borrower: {{ book_instance.borrower }}</p>
          <p{% if book_instance.is_overdue %} class="text-danger"{% endif %}>Due date: {{ book_instance.due_back }}</p>
            
          <form action="" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <table>
            {{ form.as_table }}
            </table>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
          </form>
        {% endblock %}

        ```
    - an empty action as shown, means that the form data will be posted back to the current URL of the page (which is what we want!).
    - The {% csrf_token %} added just inside the form tags is part of Django's cross-site forgery protection. 
    - Using {{ form.as_table }} as shown above, each field is rendered as a table row. You can also render each field as a list item (using {{ form.as_ul }} ) or as a paragraph (using {{ form.as_p }}).
    - here form is a template variable so use it as you like.
- ##### ModalForm
    - with a lot of fields to edit, one can use ModalForm as used below in forms.py
    ```python
    from django.forms import ModelForm

    from catalog.models import BookInstance
    
    class RenewBookModelForm(ModelForm):
        def clean_due_back(self):
           data = self.cleaned_data['due_back']
           
           # Check if a date is not in the past.
           if data < datetime.date.today():
               raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))
    
           # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
           if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
               raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))
    
           # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
           return data
    
        class Meta:
            model = BookInstance
            fields = ['due_back']
            labels = {'due_back': _('Renewal date')}
            help_texts = {'due_back': _('Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).')}
    ```
#### Generic Editing views
If one wanted to create views for predifined task like below easily..
- Open the views file (locallibrary/catalog/views.py) and append the following code block to the bottom of it:
    ```python
    from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy
    
    from catalog.models import Author
    
    class AuthorCreate(CreateView):
        model = Author
        fields = '__all__'
        initial = {'date_of_death': '05/01/2018'}
    
    class AuthorUpdate(UpdateView):
        model = Author
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'date_of_birth', 'date_of_death']
    
    class AuthorDelete(DeleteView):
        model = Author
        success_url = reverse_lazy('authors')
    ```
 
 - In this case, we use the reverse_lazy() function to redirect to our author list after an author has been deleted â€” reverse_lazy() is a lazily executed version of reverse(), used here because we're providing a URL to a class-based view attribute.
 - Create Templates 
    - The "create" and "update" views use the same template by default, which will be named after your model: model_name_form.html (you can change the suffix to something other than _form using the template_name_suffix field in your view, e.g. template_name_suffix = '_other_suffix')
      so Create the template file locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/author_form.html and copy in the text below.
        ```html
        {% extends "base_generic.html" %}
        
        {% block content %}
          <form action="" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <table>
            {{ form.as_table }}
            </table>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
          </form>
        {% endblock %}
        ```
    - The "delete" view expects to find a template named with the format model_name_confirm_delete.html (again, you can change the suffix using template_name_suffix in your view). Create the template file locallibrary/catalog/templates/catalog/author_confirm_delete.html and copy in the text below.
    ```html
    {% extends "base_generic.html" %}
    
    {% block content %}
    
    <h1>Delete Author</h1>
    
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete the author: {{ author }}?</p>
    
    <form action="" method="POST">
      {% csrf_token %}
      <input type="submit" value="Yes, delete.">
    </form>
    
    {% endblock %}
    ```
 - configure url, Open your URL configuration file (locallibrary/catalog/urls.py) and add the following configuration to the bottom of the file:
    ```python
    urlpatterns += [  
        path('author/create/', views.AuthorCreate.as_view(), name='author_create'),
        path('author/<int:pk>/update/', views.AuthorUpdate.as_view(), name='author_update'),
        path('author/<int:pk>/delete/', views.AuthorDelete.as_view(), name='author_delete'),
    ]
    ```
    - You can see that the views are classes, and must hence be called via .as_view(), and you should be able to recognize the URL patterns in each case. We must use pk as the name for our captured primary key value, as this is the parameter name expected by the view classes.
### Juice out
- Can you notice? Django is just
    - Extend model(or form) and migrate
    - Extend view that uses model
    - Extend template, create holes for context and combine template and context in view
    - Finally extend urls to let browser call the view.
